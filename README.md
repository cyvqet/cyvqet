**Systems / Backend Developer**  
Focusing on **performance**, **reliability**, and **low-level implementation**

---

I primarily focus on **systems development**, with **Go** as my main tool.  
I am gradually diving deeper into backend architecture and engineering design,  
with an emphasis on service stability, performance, and long-term maintainability.

In addition, I work on **AI agents** and explore  
**low-level frameworks and core principles** in **C / C++**.
